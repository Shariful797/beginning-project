                <li>

                </li>
            </ol>
            <h5>4. INSTALLATION</h5>
            <p>
                Licensee can only install one copy of the Licensed Software on a
                single device. The Licensee must be the primary user of the device on
                which the Licensed Software is installed. This Agreement shall apply
                to all installations of the Licensed Software. Installation of the
                Licensed Software on two or more devices is prohibited. The Licensee
                may purchase and install multiple licenses if Licensee wants to
                install software on two or more devices. Licensee shall be solely
                responsible for all expenses incurred in Licensee's installation and
                use of the Licensed Software.
            </p>
            <h5>5. SOFTWARE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM</h5>
            <p>
                ***** is committed to helping protect your privacy at all times except
                as otherwise provided in this Agreement. This statement explains the
                anonymous data collection process and usage practices for the Software
                Improvement Program of *****.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to provide and improve the software, its features, and user's
                experience, we will automatically collect, maintain process and use
                information concerning the way the various modules and functionalities
                of ***** software are being used. Information is also gathered
                anonymously for the purpose of statistical analysis about Software
                usage.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will only use such information for the purpose of providing end
                users with the best possible software experience. The collected data
                will not be disclosed, shared, sold, traded or rented to any third
                parties for marketing purposes. For users who do not wish to enable
                this service, you may opt-out in the advanced options menu during the
                installation process.
            </p>
            <h5>6. ACTIVATION</h5>
            <p>
                The Licensed Software contains technological measures that are
                designed to prevent its unlicensed or illegal use. The Licensed
                Software may contain enforcement technology that limits Licensee's
                ability to install and uninstall the Licensed Software on a machine to
                no more than a finite number of times, for a finite number of devices
                and for a defined period in time designated by the purchased License.
                The Licensed Software may require activation during installation and
                in the Documentation. If any of such applicable activation
                procedure(s) is not followed, the Licensed Software may only operate
                for a finite period of time. If activation is required, but the
                Licensee doesn't complete activation within the finite period of time
                set forth in the Documentation or explained during installation, the
                Licensed Software will cease to function until activation has been
                completed, by which time functionality will be restored. If Licensee
                has any problem with the activation process, Licensee may contact the
                Licensor customer service for support.
            </p>
            <p>7. EVALUATION COPY</p>
            <p>
                Licensee may be granted an evaluation copy of the Licensed Software
                free of charge for a finite period of time (the "Evaluation Copy").
                Certain features and/or functionality of the Licensed Software may be
                locked or unavailable in the Evaluation Copy. In order to benefit from
                all features and functionality of the Licensed Software, Licensee have
                to purchase a valid license activation key. From the moment that
                Licensee activates Licensed Software with a valid license key, the
                Evaluation Copy shall cease from being considered an Evaluation Copy
                and all the terms of this Agreement shall commence to apply in their
                entirety.
            </p>
            <h5>8. TERM</h5>
            <p>
                There are several kinds of License which Licensee may choose to
                purchase. If the Licensee choose to purchase a lifetime license, you
                may use it until terminated. If you choose to purchase a license for a
                specific period of time, you can only use it during the specific
                period. You may terminate the license at any time by destroying the
                Software, together with all copies thereof. The License will be
                terminated automatically or otherwise cease to be effective if you
                fail to comply with any term(s) or condition(s) of this Agreement. You
                shall destroy and cease using the Software, together with all copies
                thereof immediately after the termination of the License.
            </p>
            <h5>9. LICENSE TRANSFER</h5>
            <p>
                Licensee may not rent, lease, lend, sell, assign, sub-license,
                redistribute or transfer the Licensed Software or the License granted
                by this EULA without prior written consent of the Licensor.
            </p>
            <h5>10. SOFTWARE UPDATES</h5>
            <p>
                Licensor may provide Licensee with Software Updates and/or Content
                Updates from time to time at no charge during the Term of this
                Agreement. The Licensor may, at its sole discretion, decide if
                Licensee can get Software Updates and/or Content Updates free of
                charge or the Licensee has to pay for the Updates. For the purposes
                hereof, "Update" means a new version of the Licensed Software
                containing technical modifications, updated information, altered
                functionality, or any other changes that are intended by Licensor to
                improve or to add, delete or otherwise modify any aspect of the
                Licensed Software. "Content Update" shall mean an update of the
                content used by the Licensed Software that might need to be updated
                from time to time. If the Licensed Software is an Update to a previous
                version, Licensee must possess a valid License to the previous
                version. Any update provided by the Licensor to Licensee is made on a
                License exchange basis such that Licensee agrees, as a precondition
                for receiving an Update, that Licensee will terminate all of
                Licensee's rights to use any previous version of the Licensed
                Software. However, Licensee may continue to use the previous version
                only to assist in transitioning to the Updated version. Once an Update
                has been released, the Licensor may cease service or support for prior
                versions, without any notice to Licensee. Software Updates and/or
                Content Updates may be provided via the Licensed Software or on the
                Licensor websites. This License does not permit Licensee to obtain and
                use a Software Upgrade and/or a new Licensed Software version. The
                Licensed Software may require Content Updates in order to work
                effectively. The Licensor may add new functions, music track,
                elements, pictures, videos, or delete original functions, music track,
                elements, pictures, and videos in the Update Software or Upgrade
                Software.

            <h5>11. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP</h5>
            <p>
                The Licensed Software and any authorized copies that Licensee makes
                are the intellectual property of, and are owned by, the Licensor, and
                by third parties whose intellectual property has been licensed to the
                Licensor. The structure, organization, and code of the Licensed
                Software are the valuable trade secrets and confidential information
                of the Licensor and such third parties. ‚Äù The Licensed Software is
                protected by law, including without limitation, the copyright laws of
                the People's Republic of China and the United States and other
                countries, and by international treaty provisions. Except as expressly
                provided in this EULA, Licensee is not granted any intellectual
                property rights over the Licensed Software. Licensee may not make or
                publish any public statement concerning the Licensed Software or the
                Licensor without the prior express written consent of the Licensor.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Licensee can develop plug-ins properly based on the open interface
                protocol of the Licensed Software and use them in the licensed
                software based on licensee's individual legitimate needs, but firstly
                licensee must obtain explicit and prior written authorization from
                Licensor. If Licensee fails to get the aforementioned authorization,
                all the legal liabilities, including but not limited to any loss of or
                damage to any third party will be solely born by Licensee.
            </p>
            <h5>12. SUPPORT</h5>
            <p>
                The Licensor is not obligated by this EULA to provide Licensee with
                any technical support services relating to the Licensed Software;
                however, Licensee may request additional support services for an
                additional charge or get free e-mail support as the Licensor may offer
                from time to time during the term of this EULA. E-mail support
                includes business priority technical assistance for installation and
                troubleshooting, and upgrade and maintenance coverage.
